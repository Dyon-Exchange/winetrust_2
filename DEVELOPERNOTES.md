# Overview

This developer note is to document anything that may come up during chat and meeting conversation that may need consideration for implementation.  But not necessarily right away.

### Dev To Do

1. Remove all hard codes and into .env file
2. Get new developer keys for TOKEN_SECRET, REFRESH_SECRET, PINATA_API_KEY, PINATA_API_SECRET, PINATA_API_JWT
3. Move landing page out of WordPress and into vanilla html5/css
4. Need to save the condition images at the level of the Asset.  Because those images, unlike the generic 'label' type ones - which are fine stored at the Product level - are unique to each case.  So we need to do that.  They need to be added at the 'Land' stage of the logic.  Can we discuss first thing Tues?   Hope it is a simple one.
5. How does WT tie into Dyon Exchange platform
6. Consult Biser about increasing power of MongoDB server for production
7. Create an admin@winetrust.org to use for all WT and Dyon account to be used instead of using personal GMail accounts
